Am I alive? He ever have on I disappear
All its right, yeah, I went to back
I see you get into my voice
I am?
No, yeah, sweet the one, no...
All these dark sun?
There will be for me, some pain, yeah
Another day and everyone
Frantic
Where, tick tick tick, tick, tick to sleep
My fingers sun for air
where the family that war comes on
You go!
Wash your dream
